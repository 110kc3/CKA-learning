For example, if you were asked to create a pod or deployment with specific name and image you can simply run the kubectl run command.

Use the below set of commands and try the previous practice tests again, but this time try to use the below commands instead of YAML files. Try to use these as much as you can going forward in all exercises

Reference (Bookmark this page for exam. It will be very handy):

https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/conventions/



Create an NGINX Pod

kubectl run nginx --image=nginx



Generate POD Manifest YAML file (-o yaml). Don't create it(--dry-run)

kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml



Create a deployment

kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx


Generate Deployment YAML file (-o yaml). Don't create it(--dry-run)

kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml



Generate Deployment YAML file (-o yaml). Don't create it(--dry-run) with 4 Replicas (--replicas=4)

kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > nginx-deployment.yaml




Save it to a file, make necessary changes to the file (for example, adding more replicas) and then create the deployment.

kubectl create -f nginx-deployment.yaml

OR

In k8s version 1.19+, we can specify the --replicas option to create a deployment with 4 replicas.

kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx --replicas=4 --dry-run=client -o yaml > nginx-deployment.yaml










Imperative Commands with Kubectl:

Familiarize with the two options that can come in handy while working with the below commands:

--dry-run: By default as soon as the command is run, the resource will be created. 
If you simply want to test your command , use the --dry-run=client option. This will not create the resource, instead, tell you whether the resource can be created and if your command is right.

-o yaml: This will output the resource definition in YAML format on screen.


Generate POD Manifest YAML file (-o yaml). Don't create it(--dry-run)

kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml


save the YAML definition to a file and modify

kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > nginx-deployment.yaml
